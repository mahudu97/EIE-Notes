# EIE Notes

My name is Mehedi, currently an EIE4 student.

Thought I'd share the notes I made in years 1, 2, and 3 in case anyone found them useful.

Each module has the "onenote.pkg" and PDF version. So you can open in Onenote and annotate/amend easily. Or view as PDF for convenience - I recommend the former as opposed to just reading.

As always, practice makes perfect, be sure to do all the problems sheets and a couple of past papers.

Disclaimer: I'm not perfect, there are most likely technical and spelling errors throughout. Feel free to report any mistakes and I'll update appropriately.
