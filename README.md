# EIE Notes

My name is Mehedi, currently an EIE3 student.

Thought I'd share the notes I made in years 1 and 2, in case anyone found them useful.

Each module has the "onenote.pkg" and PDF version. So you can open in Onenote and annotate/amend easily. Or view as PDF for convenience - I recommend the former as opposed to just reading.

Disclaimer: I'm not perfect, there are most likely technical and spelling errors throughout. Feel free to report any mistakes and I'll update appropriately.
